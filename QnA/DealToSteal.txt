⚙️ 4. What You Should Do Next (To Seal the Deal)
📍 Step 1: Active Learning

Don’t just read questions — implement small demos:

Build a mini React Native app using Fabric + Hermes

Implement Redux Toolkit + React Query + AsyncStorage

Write custom hooks, debounce/throttle utilities, error boundaries

📍 Step 2: Coding Practice

Practice 30–40 hands-on JS coding questions:

Polyfills, async/await, Promise chaining

Data structures (arrays, objects, sets/maps)

Implement debounce, throttle, memoize, etc.

📍 Step 3: Mock Interviews

Use platforms like:

Pramp / Interviewing.io / FrontendExpert / Exponent
to simulate technical rounds (especially system design & async JS).

🎯 Topics

JS execution: Call Stack, Event Loop, Micro/Macro tasks

Hoisting, TDZ, Scope Chain, Lexical scope

Closures & Currying

this binding, bind, call, apply

var, let, const

Primitive vs Reference types

Deep vs Shallow copy

Equality: == vs ===

'use strict' mode

Garbage collection & memory leaks

💻 Coding Tasks

Implement: bind(), debounce(), throttle(), deepClone()

Flatten nested array

Compose / Pipe functions

🧠 Practice
