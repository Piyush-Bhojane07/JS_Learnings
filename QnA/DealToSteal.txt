📍 Step 1: Active Learning

Don’t just read questions — implement small demos:

Build a mini React Native app using Fabric + Hermes

Implement Redux Toolkit + React Query + AsyncStorage

Write custom hooks, debounce/throttle utilities, error boundaries

📍 Step 2: Coding Practice

Practice 30–40 hands-on JS coding questions:

Polyfills, async/await, Promise chaining

Data structures (arrays, objects, sets/maps)

Implement debounce, throttle, memoize, etc.

📍 Step 3: Mock Interviews

Use platforms like:

Pramp / Interviewing.io / FrontendExpert / Exponent
to simulate technical rounds (especially system design & async JS).

🎯 Topics

JS execution: Call Stack, Event Loop, Micro/Macro tasks

Hoisting, TDZ, Scope Chain, Lexical scope

Closures & Currying

this binding, bind, call, apply

var, let, const

Primitive vs Reference types

Deep vs Shallow copy

Equality: == vs ===

'use strict' mode

Garbage collection & memory leaks

💻 Coding Tasks

Implement: bind(), debounce(), throttle(), deepClone()

Flatten nested array

Compose / Pipe functions

🧠 Practice

JS30 challenge (https://javascript30.com/
) — pick 3 mini-projects.

Daily LeetCode Easy JS questions (arrays, strings).

🗓️ Week 2 – Modern JS + Asynchronous Mastery

Objective: Master async, promises, and modern syntax.

🎯 Topics

Promises: lifecycle, chaining, Promise.all vs allSettled

async/await (under the hood)

🗓️ Week 3 – React & React Native Core

Objective: Deep dive into React fundamentals & RN architecture.

🎯 Topics

Virtual DOM, reconciliation

Hooks: useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, custom hooks

Component lifecycle (Class vs Hooks)

React Native internals:

Bridge, JSI, Fabric, TurboModules

Hermes engine basics

Metro bundler, threading model

Props vs state vs context

StyleSheet API, Flexbox in RN

🗓️ Week 4 – TypeScript + State Management

Objective: Become comfortable with large-scale app structure.

🎯 Topics

TS basics: interfaces, generics, utility types

Typing React Components, Props, and Hooks

Redux Toolkit: slices, thunks, selectors

React Query / TanStack Query: caching, mutations, optimistic updates

Context API vs Redux

Zustand / Recoil overview

💻 Tasks

Convert RN app to TypeScript

Add Redux Toolkit store (with async API calls)

Use React Query for data fetching and caching

Type a complex component hierarchy

🗓️ Week 5 – Advanced Topics + Performance Optimization

Objective: Understand what senior engineers know.

🎯 Topics

Debounce vs Throttle in React

Memoization, React.memo, useCallback optimization

Lazy loading & code splitting

Re-renders, reconciliation performance

💻 Tasks

Optimize API-heavy RN screen

Use React Profiler + Flipper for performance

Implement infinite scroll + lazy image loading

🗓️ Week 6 – Testing, Debugging & Tooling

Objective: Prove reliability and debugging skills.

🎯 Topics

Unit testing with Jest

React Native Testing Library (RTL) basics

Detox for E2E tests

Mocking APIs, timers, async tests

Console & DevTools debugging

Crashlytics / Flipper / LogBox usage

Common JS pitfalls (floating-point, undefined errors)

💻 Tasks

Write Jest unit tests for hooks

Create one Detox E2E test

Debug performance & network issues using Flipper

🗓️ Week 7 – Deployment + Native + Ecosystem

Objective: Understand real-world project flow & CI/CD.

🎯 Topics

App signing, versioning, OTA updates (CodePush)

EAS Build, Fastlane pipelines

Native bridge creation (Android/iOS)

Expo vs Bare workflow

Deep linking, environment configs

API Security (HTTPS, tokens, environment variables)

App Store & Play Store process

💻 Tasks

Create a custom native module (e.g., device info)

Deploy a test build via EAS / TestFlight

Add Deep linking support

🗓️ Week 8 – Final Prep (Mock + System Design + Review)

Objective: Interview readiness & project articulation.

🎯 Topics

System design for mobile apps (architecture + data flow)

Handling offline-first apps

App performance strategies

Caching, pagination, optimistic updates

Security, analytics, monitoring

Common interview gotchas

💼 Mock Interview Prep

2 x JS/React rounds (Pramp / Interviewing.io)

1 x RN + System Design round

1 x HR + project storytelling round

🧠 Review Checklist
