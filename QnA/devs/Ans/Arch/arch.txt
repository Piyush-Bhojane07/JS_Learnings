archicture sturctures like mvvm and alll for the project sturctue, give me only names
Architecture Patterns for React Native:
1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
2. MVC (Model-View-Controller)
3. MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
4. Clean Architecture
5. Flux (Facebook)
6. Redux Architecture
7. MobX Architecture
8. VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router)
9. MVI (Model-View-Intent)
10. Atomic Design
11. Feature-Sliced Design
12. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
13. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
14. Onion Architecture
15. Layered Architecture
16. Component-Based Architecture
17. Event-Driven Architecture
18. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
19. Repository Pattern
20. Service Layer Pattern
These are the main architectural patterns used in React Native projects. Would you like me to explain any specific one in detail?

-------------------------------------------

which are the famous
Most Famous/Popular Architectures for React Native:
1. Redux Architecture ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
(Most popular for large apps)

2. MVVM ⭐⭐⭐⭐
(Growing fast with React Native)

3. Clean Architecture ⭐⭐⭐⭐
(Enterprise favorite)

4. Feature-Sliced Design ⭐⭐⭐
(Modern approach)

5. Component-Based Architecture ⭐⭐⭐
(React's native pattern)

6. MVC ⭐⭐
(Traditional, but still used)

7. Repository Pattern ⭐⭐⭐
(Common with API-heavy apps)

8. Atomic Design ⭐⭐
(For design systems)
