🔷 JavaScript (50 Questions)
Core Concepts
What is the difference between let, const, and var?

var, let, and const - Complete Explanation
1. var (Function-Scoped)
javascript
// 1. FUNCTION SCOPE
function testVar() {
    var x = 10;
    if (true) {
        var x = 20; // Same variable!
        console.log(x); // 20
    }
    console.log(x); // 20 (not 10!)
}
testVar();

// 2. HOISTING
console.log(y); // undefined (not ReferenceError)
var y = 5;
console.log(y); // 5

// The above is interpreted as:
var y;
console.log(y); // undefined
y = 5;
console.log(y); // 5

// 3. RE-DECLARATION ALLOWED
var z = 10;
var z = 20; // No error
console.log(z); // 20
2. let (Block-Scoped)
javascript
// 1. BLOCK SCOPE
function testLet() {
    let x = 10;
    if (true) {
        let x = 20; // Different variable!
        console.log(x); // 20
    }
    console.log(x); // 10 (not affected by inner block)
}
testLet();

// 2. HOISTING (Temporal Dead Zone)
// console.log(a); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5

// 3. NO RE-DECLARATION IN SAME SCOPE
let b = 10;
// let b = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared

// But different scopes are fine
let c = 10;
if (true) {
    let c = 20; // Different scope - no error
    console.log(c); // 20
}
console.log(c); // 10
3. const (Block-Scoped + Constant)
javascript
// 1. MUST BE INITIALIZED
// const PI; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
const PI = 3.14159;

// 2. CANNOT REASSIGN PRIMITIVE VALUES
const MAX_SIZE = 100;
// MAX_SIZE = 200; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

// 3. BUT OBJECTS/ARRAYS ARE MUTABLE!
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
person.age = 31; // ✅ This is allowed!
console.log(person); // { name: "John", age: 31 }

// But you cannot reassign the entire object
// person = { name: "Jane" }; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); // ✅ This is allowed!
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// numbers = [5, 6, 7]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
📊 Comparison Table
Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function	Block	Block
Hoisting	Yes (initialized as undefined)	Yes (TDZ - cannot access before declaration)	Yes (TDZ - cannot access before declaration)
Re-declaration	✅ Allowed	❌ Not allowed	❌ Not allowed
Re-assignment	✅ Allowed	✅ Allowed	❌ Not allowed (for primitives)

🔍 Real-World Examples
React Native Example:
javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const UserProfile = () => {
    // ✅ Good - use const for state since we don't reassign the setter
    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        // ✅ Good - use let for values that might change
        let isMounted = true;
        
        const fetchUser = async () => {
            try {
                // ✅ Good - const for API responses
                const response = await fetch('/api/user');
                const userData = await response.json();
                
                if (isMounted) {
                    setUser(userData);
                    setLoading(false);
                }
            } catch (error) {
                // ✅ Good - const for error objects
                const errorMessage = error.message;
                console.error(errorMessage);
            }
        };
        
        fetchUser();
        
        return () => {
            isMounted = false; // ✅ let allows reassignment for cleanup
        };
    }, []);
    
    // ❌ Bad - this would cause issues
    // var count = 0; // Function-scoped, could cause bugs
    
    // ✅ Good
    let count = 0; // Block-scoped, safer
    
    if (loading) {
        count = 1; // Reassignment is fine with let
        return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }
    
    return (
        <View>
            <Text>Welcome, {user.name}!</Text>
        </View>
    );
};
Common Patterns:
javascript
// ✅ Use const by default
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
const DEFAULT_CONFIG = { timeout: 5000 };

// ✅ Use let when you need to reassign
let retryCount = 0;
let isLoading = false;

// ❌ Avoid var in modern code
// var oldVariable = "don't use this";

// Loop examples
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 100); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

// With var it would be different:
for (var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 100); // 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
}
🎯 Interview Answer Summary:
"The main differences are:

var is function-scoped and hoisted with undefined initialization

let and const are block-scoped and hoisted but cannot be accessed before declaration (Temporal Dead Zone)

let allows reassignment, const does not (though objects/arrays are still mutable)

In modern development, use const by default and let when you need reassignment. Avoid var."
